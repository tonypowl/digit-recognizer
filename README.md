A neural network from scratch using NumPy to recognize handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset. Utilized Pandas for
data loading and preprocessing. The model was trained using key machine learning concepts like backpropagation and gradient
descent to accurately classify digits using mathematical models and activation function equations
